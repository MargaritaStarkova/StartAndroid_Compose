    <string name="details">Harry Putter and the Chamber of Cheesecakes is an English parody of J. K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter series by Timothy R. O\'Donnell. The main characters are Harry Putter, Ron Cheesley and Hermione Stranger. They attend Hogwashes School for Wizards and Witches and are on their sixth year (seventh if you count preschool). There is also a sequel, "Harry Putter and the Deathly Hairballs", detailing the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in their quest to destroy Lord Moldyfart, while students of Hogwashes are in panic. After it rends them to death with its sharp claws, it leaves a hairy ball behind on each of its victims, a sick kind of calling card left at the scene of each murder</string>
